This is a project that is designed to be the server companion for the
iOS-Traveller app.  The job of pointServer.py is to serve KML documents that
contain the GPS coordinate of the requested point of interest (GET City)
or of all points of interest (GET *ALL).
pointServer.py uses gps.py to manage the GPS point of interest data.
pointClient.py is an example client program to the pointServer.py program.
